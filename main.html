	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science, particularly in the analysis of algorithms. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms are those that run in polynomial time, such as O(n), O(n log n), or O(n^2), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding time complexity helps in comparing different algorithms and selecting the most efficient one for a given task. An efficient algorithm minimizes the computational resources required, ensuring faster execution and better performance, especially for large datasets. This consideration is vital in fields like software development and data processing, where optimizing performance can lead to significant improvements in user experience and resource utilization.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is an important metric, along with time complexity, for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. An algorithm with space complexity O(n) means that the amount of memory required grows linearly with the input size 'n'. This linear growth is generally considered efficient and manageable, especially compared to higher-order complexities like O(n^2) or O(2^n). Efficient use of space is crucial in applications where memory resources are limited, such as in embedded systems or mobile devices. By optimizing both space and time complexities, developers can create algorithms that not only perform well but also make efficient use of available memory, contributing to the overall efficiency and scalability of software solutions.</p>
