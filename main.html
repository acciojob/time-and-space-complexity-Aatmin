    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm, representing how the execution time increases relative to the input size. Efficient algorithms are those that can handle large inputs with minimal time increases, often characterized by their time complexity notation, such as O(1), O(log n), O(n), or O(n log n). An efficient algorithm ensures that tasks are completed faster and resources are utilized effectively, making it essential in software development, particularly in applications that require processing large datasets or real-time operations. Understanding and optimizing time complexity is crucial for creating scalable and responsive systems.

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of its input. It considers both the memory needed for the variables and the data structures used during execution. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. For instance, if the input size doubles, the memory required also doubles. This linear growth is often acceptable in many applications, as it ensures that the algorithm can handle larger inputs without excessive memory consumption. Understanding space complexity helps in designing algorithms that are both efficient and feasible for systems with limited memory resources.
