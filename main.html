    <p>    Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run as a function of the size of the input data. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's runtime. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) scales linearly with the size of the input, meaning that if the input size doubles, the time taken roughly doubles as well. Understanding time complexity is essential for evaluating and comparing the performance of different algorithms, especially when dealing with large data sets where inefficiencies can lead to significant slowdowns.
</p>
	<p>Efficient algorithms are designed to minimize time complexity, ensuring that they can handle larger inputs without a substantial increase in execution time. For instance, algorithms with lower time complexities like O(log n) or O(1) are highly efficient, often preferred in scenarios where speed is critical. On the other hand, algorithms with higher time complexities like O(n^2) or O(2^n) can become impractical for large inputs, as their execution time grows rapidly. By analyzing and optimizing time complexity, developers can create algorithms that not only solve problems correctly but also do so in a manner that is scalable and efficient, making them suitable for real-world applications.
